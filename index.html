              Hilda is an extremely adventurous and fearless girl. 
              She loves to draw in her sketchbook and is very kind to nature. 
              She is shown not to get scared easily by monsters and can outrun and outsmart them.

              Twig is a protective, trusty and brave animal who likes to help Hilda. 
              When he is protective, he goes in front of Hilda and growls at anyone that 
              she doesn't know when they go up to her. He also has a sharp sense of smell and is 
              quick to realize something is not right.

              Hilda's mother is caring and supportive, but at times she can worry too much about 
              Hilda not having any "normal" friends her age. Since she lived in Trolberg for a good 
              portion of her childhood, she has a soft spot for the city, and had much less trouble 
              with moving there than Hilda did.

              David tends to be quickly scared and easily distracted, as well as a bit clumsy. 
              It often takes his friends' encouragement to get him over his fears.
              David has at least one talent, that being he's a great singer.
              For this reason he has tried several times to audition for the Warblers, the choir 
              of the Sparrow Scouts.

              Frida is strong minded, intelligent, and highly organized, and always 
              makes detailed plans for everything (so much in fact that Hilda actually 
              wondered if Frida was raised by Elves).She is also competitive, always 
              wanting to be the best. However, she tends to overthink things and tries too hard 
              to be seen as perfect.

            <p class="texto">
              Kaisa is usually calm, but can be rather strict with rules. She has the uncanny 
              ability to always know exactly what book people are looking for, even before they can 
              ask her about it. Another quirky thing about her is that she has memorized the entire 
              layout of St. Guglows Cemetery. This last thing she doesn't want to admit however.

              Alfur is a member of the Aldric Family. He loves writing reports about Trolberg to 
              the other Aldric elves. He is mostly known for paperworks and contracts, such as 
              contracts for the exiles from the "The Lost Clan" and paperworks so that other humans 
              can see him, such as Hilda and Frida.
